Histogram-Free Multicanonical Sampling (using numerical integration as an example)
##################################################################################

This code is distributed with the paper "Histogram-free multicanonical Monte 
Carlo sampling to calculate the density of states", published in Computer Physics 
Communications (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.09.025).

The program implements a novel Monte Carlo algorithm to obtain the density of 
states of a physical system, expanded in a chosen basis set. It can be regarded as 
a descendant and a hybrid method closely related to the multicanonical method and 
Wang-Landau sampling. But unlike these existing algorithms that return the density 
of states as a numerical array, this algorithm avoids binning of a continuous 
variable and is able to express the density of states as a closed-form expression. 
It is thus suitable for the study of the statistical mechanics and thermodynamic 
properties of physical systems where the density of a continuous state variable is 
of interest.
